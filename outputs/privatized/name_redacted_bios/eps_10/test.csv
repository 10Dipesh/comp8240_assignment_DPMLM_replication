"Born in [REDACTED], [REDACTED], to a [REDACTED]-American family, [REDACTED] began his working life as a manual laborer before spending two years in [REDACTED]. Relocating to [REDACTED], where he married, he got involved in [REDACTED] (CSO), through which he helped laborers register to vote. In 1959, he became the [REDACTED]'s national director, a position based in [REDACTED]. In 1962, he left the [REDACTED] to co-found the [REDACTED], based in [REDACTED], [REDACTED], through which he launched an insurance scheme, a credit union, and the [REDACTED] newspaper for farmworkers. Later that decade, he began organizing strikes among farmworkers, most notably the successful [REDACTED] grape strike of 1965–1970. Amid the grape strike, his NFWA merged with [REDACTED] [REDACTED] to form the [REDACTED] in 1967. Influenced by the [REDACTED] independence leader [REDACTED], [REDACTED] emphasized direct nonviolent tactics, including pickets and [REDACTED], to pressure farm owners into granting strikers' demands. He imbued his campaigns with [REDACTED] symbolism, including public processions, [REDACTED], and fasts. He received much support from labor and leftist groups but was monitored by [REDACTED]).",Activists & Humanitarians
"In the early 1970s, [REDACTED] sought to expand the [REDACTED]'s influence outside [REDACTED] by opening branches in other [REDACTED] states. Viewing illegal immigrants as a major source of strike-breakers, he also pushed a campaign against illegal immigration into the [REDACTED], which generated violence along the [REDACTED] border and caused schisms with many of the [REDACTED]'s allies. Interested in co-operatives as a form of organization, he established a remote commune at [REDACTED]. His increased isolation and emphasis on unrelenting campaigning alienated many [REDACTED] farmworkers who had previously supported him, and by 1973 the [REDACTED] had lost most of the contracts and membership it won during the late 1960s. His alliance with [REDACTED] Governor [REDACTED] helped ensure the passing of [REDACTED] of 1975, although the [REDACTED]'s campaign to get its measures enshrined in [REDACTED]'s constitution failed. Influenced by the [REDACTED] religious organization, [REDACTED] re-emphasized communal living and purged perceived opponents. Membership of the [REDACTED] dwindled in the 1980s, with [REDACTED] refocusing on anti-pesticide campaigns and moving into real-estate development, generating controversy for his use of non-unionized laborers.",Artists & Musicians
