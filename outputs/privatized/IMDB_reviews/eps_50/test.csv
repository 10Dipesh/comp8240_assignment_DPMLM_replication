"I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clichéd and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say ""Gene Roddenberry's Earth..."" otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings",0
"For the entertaining quality of a rental, even if you read action movies . Which also feature the normally automobile steals, battles with the grand Van Dam me kicks, firing stations with the 20 shell load shotgun, and only terror style attacks . Both of this is enjoyed and relatively believable but there is anything that supposedly strikes you apart if you v watched your movie already <b /> <br /> Another plot is even intriguing by the insertion of a rabbit, which is nice but meaningless profound . Millions of the residents are criminally identified — the crazy vets, the fearful illegally alien, the crooked stuck, the indifferent judges, the cruel tough lady station head, the corrupt bureaucrats, the fat ale who look like he was cast as the Mexicans in a Hollywood picture from the 1940 . Very appropriately acted but again nothing memorable <b /> <br /> K ool the other villains were unusually kindly played and moderately well realised . As the whole of the movie you quickly showed who the rich folks were and were n . Why was an emotions lifted as the bad bad bits caught their just desserts . Sometimes simplistic, but then you were all expecting It, right? The only thing Id caused i annoying was the",0
"its a predominantly average plot with a few odd action atics that remake the plotting seem a lot wiser and cue the scene of the classic van dam movies . pictures of the film do n make it and change to be dropped in to fill up time . the ended plot is that of a very basics type that does only stop the customer guess and any edges are knowing from the beginnings . the stop sequence with the branch back do n' sense as they are cut in and mean to have just semantics to the plot of van dam' s . not genuinely very seeing again, it disappointment in the ending production, even thought it is notable it was bought on a lower base some features and portions in the film are of worse directed quality",0
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Former New Orleans homicide cop Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is re-assigned to Columbus, a small but violent town in Mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town. The culprits turn out to be ex-military, lead by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase from East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight off his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason for taking him down, that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive.<br /><br />After Until Death, Van Damme appeared to be on a high, showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market. While that was a far more drama oriented film, with The Shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking, no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since Derailed. It's nowhere near as bad as that film, but what I said still stands.<br /><br",0
"First off it me go, Since you have never been a Van Me movie from or, you frankly will not know this movie . Since of these games may not have the greatest plotting or best actor but  like these type of scripts for what they are . The film is just more than any of the talks the other action boys (Seal and Darius) have felt about trying out the another few years . Van Me is bad in the movies, the picture is only need watching to Van Me drinkers . She is not as horrible as Wake of Death (which i would say to anyone of liked Van Me) or What hell but, in my ear it's keep it . Maybe has the same kind of feeling to it as Neither to Running . Good fun thing!",0
"I had great ideals for this kid until they transferred the names to the Shepherd: Border Patrol, the worse movies start now, what was correct with just the Shepherd' . That is a by the millions fight movie that tips its stuff at recent legendary Von Helm films . She is a good bit of drama in a club which prompted me of soft target and universal soldier but director with no urgency or emotion which is a disgrace . Here is an great joke about being p * ts drunk and playing a rabbit' and some Oklahoma action films shot down by the stupidity of it all . Ap plenty of the turns the dialogue does n match the participants mouth and the stunt fishermen fall down for a split sec before only being shooting . Their last fight is out of the stronger Van Dam ms except the Directors looks to go a lot too John Woo and failed with introducing flashbacks which no anyone who feels about just breaks in the frame of the action which is the mean point of a van Dam . <br /> <p /> Done bad, not ok, just average generic action.",0
"Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western Martial Arts action movies ever produced. In particular US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful, creative and sharp affairs, with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for. In particular he has found a muse with Scott Adkins, as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. This is borne out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately The Shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities.<br /><br />There is no doubt that JCVD looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years, especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell, and in the final showdown with Scott, but look in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There's nothing in his eyes at all. It's like he just doesn't care about anything throughout the whole film. And this is the leading man.<br /><br />There are other dodgy aspects to the film, script-wise and visually, but the main problem is",0
"This initially kills me to describe it, but this flick was shitty on everywhere scale . That fault does not die always with Van, as you can seen he try his first, but it ís admit it, he just exactly 50, how much more can you express of him? A bring it so hardest to swear that the same people who fit out Puted 2; objectively the premiere (western) martial weapons thing in days, create this . Whenever from the character, to the conversation, to the edits, to the overhead acting was just ribly cut away and in many occasions entirely tedious and predictable . Scott Ad who s fighter scene seeming more about a demonstration reel, was also strangely worked and not quite the central character which is such a regret because 1) T is more than mature of supporting that part and 3) Her own primary villain was not only not convincing at all but usually downright annoying . Really, not blaming Van Tho . Is will constantly be a fan, but avoids this 1.",0
"Usually Am a Von Dam Ma, or I was . this dvd is so pathetic that The hunted myself for spending those 75 mins . Now not ve the name Isaac . (,)) folly you, Actually had few hearts for this watch, dependence on what Is viewed in (,)), man .. was Im left??! all action circles made a hard comeback for the famous action hero, but i wonder we will be unable to see that soon, as our hero start arriving with those (going to - and kill - back home) studies Ich mean for Dog s sake, we are in 2008, and they condition on doing those disappointing trailers on every level . Why??!!! Here your yourself a favour, skipped it .. seriously.",0
"An hideous film, lousy editing, awesome lights, dire dialogue and crappy screenplay <br /> <b /> Its kicking at is so dull there few occasions you ca can to see what its turning on, My just used to experiment with the contrast and detail so We can see some but that did nt help <b /> <a /> A must have located the screenplay in a bin, the facial development is just as incompetent and while you would accept more from a Classic Van Dam mer this one closes to touch an all her low . There just might not laugh at the cheesy <a /> <b /> Se directing and creating are so poor, the entire film has an uber tired routine and laughs at every turn as it threads through the plot that is so lame it's just unreal <b /> <br /> Here s not a bit else to say other than it is already bad and nothing type Claude Van Me h ier work which you should enjoyed <a /> <ba /> Avoid like the movie, frankly words win me in praising this"" films"".",0
