"Picture this: a friend of mine was in from California for the second weekend of Jazz Fest. You know, the one that was rained out. He texts me at the last minute, on a Monday, and asks me if I want to grab dinner. Yes! Okay, where? That's a tough one- restaurants that are open on Mondays in New Orleans are hard to come by. A quick Yelp search told me that The Flaming Torch was open. I had never been, so I crossed my fingers and we headed over.  I made reservations, but they were completely unnecessary because we were the only people here on a Monday. Everything on the menu looked fantastic, but I decided to start simple. The soup of the day was tomato basil. For those of you who don't know, my two favorite soups are tomato basil and French onion and I am very particular about both. The soup came out and it's looked so good. It looked so good I forgot to take a picture! I know- blasphemy! It was nice and thick and really rich. It was almost more like a stew and I ate all of it and almost asked for seconds.  For my entree I got the redfish topped with shrimp. Not only was the fish delicious, but it was topped with an amazing sauce and the shrimp were fat and full of flavor. It also came with a nice side of roasted potatoes and green beans, which complimented the fish nicely. This dish was one of the more expensive on the menu, but it was more than worth it.  I'll be honest, when I saw some of the reviews of this place I almost skipped it, but I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did. Our service was excellent and the food was fantastic and my out of town visitor was quite happy with my selection. I would definitely return to The Flaming Torch, especially on a Monday.",1
"Oh, Happy Day! I have been waiting for this new location to open and I was so anxious, I was one of the first to arrive on opening day. They informed me I was the first to sit at the bar and that is an honor I will cherish for ever. This location is much larger then the Clayton location, but still has the same decor and feel.   This morning I made it an avocado themed breakfast. I started out with avocado toast. I call it my breakfast appetizer. It's so simple and yet so delicious; wheat toast, feta, cilantro, lime, cracked pepper and smear of avocado. Yum-Yum.   Next was my entree, Avocado and Spinach Benedict. It was a traditional English Muffin topped with avocado, sautéed spinach and two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce. I consider this a healthy breakfast - LOL. In my humble opinion, Half & Half has the best hollandaise sauce.   I like that they serve Blueprint Coffee, which is a local roaster. It's nice to see local businesses supporting each other. I try not only to shop local, but to eat local too.   The staff was professional and friendly. I liked how they were asking everyone their names, so they can learn and greet their future regulars.   Will I return? - I'll be there tomorrow for breakfast again.   When: September 5, 2017 Why: Breakfast on Opening Day",3
