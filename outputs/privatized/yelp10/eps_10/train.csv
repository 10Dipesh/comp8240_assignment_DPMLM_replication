These ladies were definitely sisters, and they admitted to kinship with the owners. As firsttimers, we ordered a cross section of the offerings: Chicken 65 for an app; Began Bhurta (veggie curry dish), and Chicken Korma (mildly sweet and loudly hot at the same time). The house put down a plate with Papadum and two dipping sauces, which was a nice gesture. Garlic Naan, Mango Lassi and Chai completed the symphony. The ""65"" dish came out deep red and slightly crispy. It was a delicious opening gambit. It was expertly grilled so the tops and edges were near-black, making it visually stunning. The eggplant (Began Bhurta) came in a deep silver dish and thick curry sauce. It mixed well with the Basmati Rice and was great for sopping with the Naan. The Korma arrived in a yogurt/creamy/nutty champagne-colored curry with a nice amount of fresh cut chicken. Everything was ordered, ""hot,"" and was true to its word. The lassi and chai helped to reduce the heat as needed, and allowed us to continue through to the end of the meal with calling the fire department. The Garlic Naan was served flat on a wooden board rather than in a basket (nice touch), and the bowls of rice were more the enough to cover our main dishes. I have not been to every other Indian kitchen in Philly, but of the many I have tried in the region, Imli is right up there with the best of them. It offers a pleasing combination of cool atmosphere, warm, efficient service, and excellent cuisine. It may not be strictly South Indian (who cares), but it certainly knows how to create an unforgettable meal. Try to get there soon.",4

So, the thing to do is order the combo, throw away the sides and biscuit and go to town on the chicken itself.
