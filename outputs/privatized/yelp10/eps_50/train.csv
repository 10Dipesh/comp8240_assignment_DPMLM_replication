"An award winning restaurant is long overdue. They've come a long way since, they first opened. I was delighted when they closed their location in June to focus on another endeavor. Their attention to detail and creativity with their food continues and they've won me over. They've won me over so much, that I have become a regular customer... I highly recommend that you follow them on Facebook, where you can find their private menu items and weekly Slam Burger. The said and also Slam Burgers are private menu items and favorites of mine, but the weekly Slam Burgers always, catch my eye. The Bacon Burger is always a favorite Brunch item for me. I love how they change it up and get creative with it sometimes. I really like their Goldfish Burger.

"SkINFULLY RECRUMPTIOUS! all after stuffing our bellies with food from the't which, we just couldn't resist walking from Grammar to Piccione and grabbing a box of tasty treats to take home. We were tempted to buy a whole box, but we stayed home and we chose the treats and we enjoyed them when we got home.�.

When we got home we could not resist, we had to try at least one of these decadent treats. We chose Cream Cannoli because the cream filling sent our taste buds into a different place. The shell was flaky and the cream filling was just as good. This is probably the best cannoli I have ever tasted. also what I made at home last night. For dessert we paired the cheesecake with fresh berries that had been macerated. We put fresh strawberries, on each side and a could taste the cheesecake without a distraction. I will say, this is the best cheesecake in the city. I've had the factory, daddy's and Hank's and I am here to say this is by far head and shoulders above all three of them. We both gasped and said, ""Oh, my God"" as we took our first bites. The strawberries were a treat on the side. We both enjoyed our cake plain. The Sfoliatella Riccia was perfect the next morning with coffee. I can not remember when we ate the Rum Baba, but I do remember that I was pissed off that I had to share it and did not get to eat the whole thing. Now that I have been to Piccione Pastry, I will change my eating habits when dining in The Loop. I will be sure to always leave room for a sweet treat from PP.",3

This is a fairly cool bar and one of the best spots to watch jazz. S They also have a nice second floor. S The cover charge can be a bit steep sometimes by Frenchmen St. Louis.

"What a great experience we had at Aussie Restaurant. They do a great job with the set up. It's totally different than anything I have seen. I wish I got the seats in the back! Breakfast was so quick and delicious. So I had the beef tenderloin with arugula and the fried shrimp. My brother had the meaty burger with french fries. I really liked the fries more than the burger. I probably would have liked more tomato sauce and more onions. The burger I had was too hot for me. I could use some water, but it was a lot. My brother gave me french fries. And the arugula sauce tasted really good to me. I think the burger was okay. The shrimp were nice and juicy but not chewy as much. We also tried the watermelon lemonade which was good but tasted sweet. I mixed it with some homemade green tea so it couldn't be too sweet. said the counter space in the dining room was nice, clean, and wide and we were close so it was not crowded. I think they have two or three other options and they even have a drive thru. I love that there are multiple ways to get your food. for you so much for the great experience!,"" This was a first, but not a last for Aussie Grill.",8

"Everytime I come here, I am finally to the point where I love Old Navy. But when I go there, I do not always seem to find what I am looking for. My last trip to Old Navy was to get a dress for my new baby. I really thought this would be the best, but they have an extremely limited selection of baby clothes. So I check out the clearance section. The baby clothes section is in the very back. Women's clearance is down in the back, and down by the toy section, and men's clearance is in the lower back down by the men's department. Nothing surprises me. of only problem for me is that I keep looking and eventually, things start to surprise me. I try some things on and end up missing a few things. people�, Old Navy is just boring to me. The colors aren't as bright or bright as other stores. It's a small department store, though. It's a relatively small store, so that's why they are limited in size. at of the best things was that I can always fit my little one into the dress with no problem. I love Old Navy wherever it is, for that reason, not for anything.",8

After ambling in, we stopped to take a look at the menu. I was definitely in a mood for a variety of dishes and drinks, but managed to stick to only a few. toWe were given copies of the check out receipt, which really impressed me. aOn the back it reads:""We believe that the art of hospitality lies in the art of good food."" I'll stick to that. I had Tikka Masala(with curry), which came wrapped in a bright red sauce with garlic and onions, and was quite tasty. The Mulligan werearta as well, and were just delicious other especially with the chunky friesplant I expected. They cheated a bit on the Garlic Naan by bringing us regular Naan painted with garlic butter. It didn't work, as it was not integrated into the bread, but sat on the surface, and lacked the baked garlic pieces I love in true Garlic Naan. A disappointing way to pay an extra buck. The Mango Lassi was pretty good, but a little thin from using milk rather than yogurt. A nice plate of rice came with the meal. This was a meal in which we were more engrossed in the conversation than attentive to our food. The strong brotherhood carried the day, and the meal became background.

So I think that next year I will do two things differently: I will be in a different group. I think that I was at the beginning of the parade and my body was kind of still getting used to the idea. And I might go to a Chewbacchanal been, because I think that will add to the fun.",1
"I parkedNear THIS shop for THE parade on Saturday. And thought,""bittersweet? i knows them... pop up? market? Who worries? CHOOCOLATE!"" so i walked in. I was in desperate need for a tea and they had several choices, spiced. The tea was good, sweet but not bitter. But i also thought I wanted an apple cranberry scone and a chocolate bark. Both were very good and the scone was delicious. I could have snacked on both over the course of the day. So many cranberries! The chocolate bark was thick and rich and delicious. yearThe shop was nice but crowded. There were a lot of people decked out, party-shop style. But there were also lots of people thinking other people looked like me and were too busy to notice. had if this shop was near my home and work, I would be in heaven! I couldn't wait to go inside and try their refrigerated tea.",2

"Imli(Tamarind) Curry House is on Cheyunk Avenue, a few blocks west of Broadway.� It is on one of the narrow points of the main thoroughfare and is not yet fully developed. s The up, there is no street parking to be found here. s The down, is that Imli does not benefit from turning down dining tables for their guests. s It stands on its own, an authentic South Asian restaurant that is well worth visiting. When you live in a neighborhood you get the best of both worlds; the peaceful ambude of being in a gentrifying urban area, and a pleasant spot to come in for a good South Asian Roast. So thank you! s On Tuesday, there was only a few people when we arrived. s First impressions were very pleasant, with oddities due to its location on the narrow point of the avenue surrounded by transecting buildings; soft gray and white hues of walls and windows, a comfortable place to feel the heat emanating from the outdoor space, and the large windows overlooking the outside courtyard, offering views of the surrounding city. Two young men arrived with drinks and food in hand, and invited us to sit down. We chose a small round table with a view of the streetscape without, and the whole room within. These ladies were definitely sisters, and they admitted to kinship with the owners. As firsttimers, we ordered a cross section of the offerings: Chicken 65 for an app; Began Bhurta (veggie curry dish), and Chicken Korma (mildly sweet and loudly hot at the same time). The house put down a plate with Papadum and two dipping sauces, which was a nice gesture. Garlic Naan, Mango Lassi and Chai completed the symphony. The ""65"" dish came out deep red and slightly crispy. It was a delicious opening gambit. It was expertly grilled so the tops and edges were near-black, making it visually stunning. The eggplant (Began Bhurta) came in a deep silver dish and thick curry sauce. It mixed well with the Basmati Rice and was great for sopping with the Naan. The Korma arrived in a yogurt/creamy/nutty champagne-colored curry with a nice amount of fresh cut chicken. Everything was ordered, ""hot,"" and was true to its word. The lassi and chai helped to reduce the heat as needed, and allowed us to continue through to the end of the meal with calling the fire department. The Garlic Naan was served flat on a wooden board rather than in a basket (nice touch), and the bowls of rice were more the enough to cover our main dishes. I have not been to every other Indian kitchen in Philly, but of the many I have tried in the region, Imli is right up there with the best of them. It offers a pleasing combination of cool atmosphere, warm, efficient service, and excellent cuisine. It may not be strictly South Indian (who cares), but it certainly knows how to create an unforgettable meal. Try to get there soon.",4
"i've lived in Godfrey for a while and have been ordering pizza at Joe's several times. I just realized, I had never sung their pizza. Now it's time to show them some love with a positive attitude. he ( Joe's has dine-in, carry-out and delivery. I have tried any of the three. I haven't tried, delivery. I live so close and have such little choice, so I never ever pick-up my pizza. However, I can say the dine-in staff is nice and friendly and the carry-out is always open when I walk in.,"". My go to STL pizza is the pizza. I'm a southern foodie and like my pizza, thick and thin. My favorite toppings are cheese, Italian sausage and Jalapeños. For me, a pizza is not a pizza if it don't have Jalapeños. Joe's is creative with the toppings and cheese, so their pizzas are very good. I also like that they cut the pizza like a sandwich, not just into slices like the typical Mexican restaurant does. Oh, I have always liked the chicken wings too. They are both bone-in and boneless. My favorite is the bone-in. They fry them extra crisp and their buffalo sauce give just the right amount of zing. Their salads are mostly iceberg lettuce, but the toppings and dressing makes them acceptable. A bonus of dining-in, they have an amazing variety of wine and beer to enjoy with your meal. They have 12 different wines and 12 draft beers. That's more than some sports bars and regular restaurants have. I'm going to keep coming back and I plan to try some of their pasta dishes and sandwiches in the future.",3
"Went to Pizza Hut on Friday night with two of my friends. s We ate on the back patio which was nice, but the combination of the bright lights and humidity created a candlelight effect that was giving me an obnoxious headache. s Eventually, we turned on the music and the Jamaican food slowly arrived. s The yelpers had very good flavor and I would say that they were all delicious~ The staff were very nice(as were the friendly staff members who also refilled the chicken and the fruit salad) but the food took a long time to come through. s Not really a big deal to my group of friends at first since we waited three hours already, but I could see how it could be frustrating if they were hungry and didn't want to sit around for three hours. s they her last minute people and were veryISH. s I wish we had ordered shrimp because each dish had six plates and there were six of us. s Two of us had the jerk chicken chicken platters and the other had the mango chicken platter. s The chicken was delicious and very tender but maybe a little too tender for the six plates. s The mango chicken was very tender, but my friend kept coming across a couple of broken pieces on the plate-- I think it might have been harder to see them in the mango sauce versus the jerk sauce where you could see them more clearly. I'm glad we got to check it out but I don't see myself dining here often with so many other options that I prefer in the city.

"I Recently had a""20's"" inspired photo shot with Make Me Up, and they send me here(right next door to Make Me Up) to get my hair styled really well.) They decided that they wanted to do a wet set on my hair, which was actually quite easy. It consisted of putting a""wet mix"" into your hair, styling the hair with your shampoo, covering it with hair spray and then sitting under a blowdryer for about an hour while it sets and dries. Even though the process was difficult, my stylist Jacqueline did a great job. She worked quickly and efficiently to get my hair styled. The hardest part, was just sitting under the dryer for a really long time while it dried and set. whateline did such a good job, that my hair didn't go dry for the rest of the day, but i'm sure that I probably could have layered off it and worn it the very next day without it looking any better to me.� If you are looking for a""different"" and less""complicated"" hairstyle, Michael not be the place to go.",1

I was able to take some of it home to eat later and that's always a plus. Also I really like how large the dining room is here, during the day.

No one will mistake China Café for fine dining, but it seems to have found its equilibrium at a higher point than most other local wok shops.

I ordered three plates of chicken parmagiana, panini aglioaccio and a side dish(balsamic). new A lot was left on the table when I walked in. There were two and a half layers, lightly breaded and deep fried in olive oil, covered in rich red sauce. It was beautifully cooked and a real crowdpleaser. The sauce included a special recipe to make even more marinara. Serving it in a large bowl on its own, the chef used pre-minced tomatoes rather than thinly sliced and sautéed them, turning them to soft and juicy, rather than the golden browned garlic I love in pasta. A bit of a disappointment. The small salad was fine, but using only one cherry tomato seemed rather retentive. Overall, it was a satisfactory meal that would have scored better had there been a stronger effort on the linguini sauce and more generosity with the salad. Still, the chicken warmed the heart and I walked away with leftovers, so the negatives are muted. 3.5 STARS",4

It turned out to be better because they had all of the chicken rather than just the wings.� so when I got home and opened the box I washeld a chicken breast and wings that were larger than I had seen on other places. It left me wondering how they made these things. The food was as bright orange as the box it was in, and very textured. Of course, the Cumin and Salt in the Spicy Sauce spoiled the flavor. But, the chicken was very tender and very juicy. The breast itself was also better than what I had gotten at the other place. week before. The chicken easily parted from the bone and my fingers pulled off most of what was edible. The rest I worked over with a fork to get into all the bone crannies. The side dish (coleslaw) was pedestrian, and the biscuit was fairly deflated by the time I got to it. So, the thing to do is order the combo, throw away the sides and biscuit and go to town on the chicken itself. It may not be the same as what is available in those little chicken shacks on the side of the road in Virginia or North Carolina, but it will do nicely up in Jersey on a wintery night.",4

"The Fly is a bit of a local secret that gets FAR more tourists than many other parts of the city. "" Being hidden back behind the buildings just makes it more relaxing because you get to sit high up on the levee and look down into the river below. which There is a decent amount of open grassy space to play golf, volleyball, throw a Frisbee, let your dog out for a quick game of fetch or just enjoy a little more open space than a lot of other spots in the city. can It is also a nice spot outside to enjoy a bit of scenery and watch the Mississippi River pass by while you sip on a daiquiri or two nearby. — It is a nice relaxing spot and a great place for relaxing depending on your mood.- Unfortunately they are building more and more buildings around, taking away from the open space and natural beauty of the area and this development has generated enough controversy that it seems to have at least stopped any further development for the time being. they say it is one of the nicest spots to sit down and have fun anywhere in the Uptown area.",6

"Yummy, yummy I have it in my tummy and I love it. this they a lovely picnic lunch out at Pi to celebrate. We began the day with a huge plate of Blazed Wings topped with home made blue cheese and bacon. These wings have enough fat to give you a headache, but not too much to bite you in the ass either. I usually do not eat chicken wings, I like the cheesy flavor of the wings. However, that blue cheese was so delicious I could not just let it sit there without eating it. "" also, I did not eat any of those chicken wings, but I dipped one of my carrot sticks in the most delicious blue cheese sauce. I really like that Pi uses carrots over the traditional celery that most restaurants use in their salads. Besides the flavor, carrots are a healthier doggie than celery so I do not feel guilty when I dip my chicken wings.�. We followed up our delicious Blazed Wings with a pizza from North Beach Chico. I know where South Beach is, but not sure about North Beach. Well, it really don't matter, because this pizza was delicious. The pizza was made with a homemade homemade pizza sauce, Mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese, also green peppers. That combination of toppings is awesome enough, but we added ricotta & fresh basil. OMG, that pizza was amazing. It was so amazing I wish Pi delivered. Our server was friendly and charming, which adds to the dining experience. I've have now dined at the CWE and the Delmar locations. In the future you will see me dining at the best of the two, Delmar.",3

"Gibby's is one of several Gibson's themed ice cream joints that dot central Bucks County.. It is all red, white, jutting a her hairline, surrounded by old fashioned balconies that provide the backdrop needed for a nostalgic, nostalgic smoothie.It sits at the end of Old Street, just south of Little Valley Road in Levittown, Pa., across from a short line of high rise commercial walkways that can give the impression that you are more than just an ice cream snicker, but rather a world traveler.... The place serves classic Gibson-scream, with a nod to vanilla and strawberry on occasion. Given the lack of variety compared to other joints in the area that offer at least a few different vanilla flavors, I went with the vanilla flavored Butter Pecan in a brownie bowl. so for USD3.50, it was a hit, or more accurately, something else I wanted to try. more also, the only real complaint here was that the creme grace were not as good as the other places in the area. all not sure who makes this stuff, but it had a great flavor; nor was it as thick and creamy as others. from so Butter Pecan had a nutty texture, and lacked the mild saltiness of the pecan that so well offsets the usual sugar rush on the tongue. The Black Raspberry had a mildly tart afterbite. Not bad, but had me wondering why it was there. After the individual scoops melted and merged into each other, it was more enjoyable. Still, not the heavy smooth happy zazz found in Jo-Jo's, nor the amazing cool creaminess of Dairy Delight.",4
