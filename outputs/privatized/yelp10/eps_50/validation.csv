"My recent visit to The Block, gives them an extra star. I'm happy to say, the CWE location is now on the same level as their sister location in Webster Groves.   As those who follow my reviews, know I am a big fan of Fried Green Tomatoes. So when I saw them on the menu as an appetizer, I couldn't resist. Their green tomatoes were almost like a salad with the additional mixed greens and strips of bacon. The coating around the tomatoes was thick and crispy, but still giving you the great taste of fresh green tomato. If dining at lunch time, it could almost be a meal itself.   My entree was the Pork Chop, which was thick, tender and juicy. It was served in a hot cast iron skillet with sautéed vegetables. I love the other white meat and The Block always serves it up well.   I saved room for dessert, so I was excited to try their Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée. It was a sweet treat.  If creme brûlée is on the menu, I order it and The Block, did it well. I'm always amazed at the crisp top on a brûlée and how creamy it is beneath. The vanilla flavor of this one, was strong which is fine with me, since vanilla is my favorite flavor.  A special touch that I like here at The Block is the way they serve salt & pepper. They don't use the typical shakers, they have small ramekins with tiny spoons. I've never had to use them, my food has always been seasoned well, but I like the unique presentation.   I'll be returning soon to try their burger for lunch. Plus, I want more Brussels Sprouts, since I didn't enjoy an order this visit.   When: June 25, 2006 Why: Dinner",3

Both cherry ice was rich but did nt not act out either way . Approximately $2 for a light ice and mini . Service was welcoming and they have a help selection of different mustard.",5
"We had lunch on Fat Tuesday at Baileys' Range and were totally surprised. I have drug my feet coming here due to the mixed reviews and now regret that I didn't come sooner.  Not only did BR amaze us with burgers, but their wings, chili and fries were equally as good.   Our feast at Bailey's begun with Smoked Pablano Chicken Wings and a Cup of Chili. We enjoyed the wings, they provided a different twist to the traditional ""hot"" wings and the chili was kick ass. The chili had a spice that provided a good kick that we could not name, but loved it just the same. It was topped with melted cheese and croutons. Croutons are a nice upgrade from oyster crackers and add an additional flavor.   To test a new burger restaurant, we figured it was best to try the ""basic"" burger. If they can not do a basic burger, how will they be able to do the ""specialty"" burgers. They nailed it! Our burgers were juicy, cooked to our specifications and served with all the toppings. Bailey's doesn't stop at a good burger, they put it on a house made bun, that can rival some bakery buns.   We shared a small order of fries and I can tell you a small is enough to satisfy two. Their fries are house cut, no frozen pre-cut fries at BR. As our sauce we choose ""crazy catsup"", which I wish could be bought to take home. I love the way they serve their catsup, in the small mason jars. I recently have become a big fan of places that provide catsup in small cups instead of nasty bottles.   A visit to Bailey's Range would not be complete without having a shake. Again, we went with the a traditional shake instead of one their now famous ""boozy shakes"".  I had my favorite flavor, strawberry and Brad got creative and mixed vanilla ice cream with blueberry sorbet. They said, they have not had anyone mix ice cream and sorbet before. His creation was fantastic, he joked that he is glad we do not live in a loft downtown, because he would have one everyday. The shakes were better then a specialty parlor down on Locust.   Our waitress was friendly and provided great service. I will be honest, the reason they did not get a five is fault of the kitchen. All the food was excellent, but we had just received our wings and chili when another server approached with our burgers. Next time, we will hold back and not order burgers until we are finished enjoying our appetizers. However, they took ownership of the error and without complaining they made it right by treating us to our shakes and removing them from our bill.   Bailey's Range, I'll be back. You gave me good service, good food and I like that your carryout vessels are eco-friendly.",3
"A Ouse s location has already uploaded a nice snowball ""stand,"" which is ostensibly an enclosed drop room you can ask from or you can register from inside the place .

Right perhaps is not Mike' or Plum Streets but it can put other of the other snow locations in the town a value for their dollar!

"The words ""ice cream"" and ""water ice"" usually fill me with happy thoughts, but when combined with the word ""Cabana,"" my mood sours.  One night last summer I had a craving for vanilla custard (that's ""soft serve"" for those of you who don't speak South Jersey) so off to Cabana I went.  Now, I get that ""soft serve"" is supposed to be softer than hard ice cream.  But is it supposed to be so soft that it starts melting all over your hand as you pay?  No.  Is it then supposed to implode into a hidden ice cream cavern before falling off the cone and onto the asphalt before you even reach the car?  No.  Vowing to boycott Cabana, a full year passed before I found myself giving them another chance when out with a group of friends the other night.  Had we not been pressed for time, I would have happily driven us all to Maple Shade Custard Stand, one of my favorite places on Earth.  However, Cabana was on the way and it had been a while since the mishap so I figured, why not?  This is why not.  My friend stepped up and ordered her hot fudge sundae.  They were out of hot fudge.  At 7 p.m. on a Friday night.  Two minutes later, a guy came in requesting blue raspberry water ice.  They were out (natch), and when the guy left, one of the Bratz dolls behind the counter remarked that water ice is artificially flavored anyway so it all tastes the same.  Awesome.   Luckily I had not already placed an order, so I hit up the McDonald's drive through for a $1 hot fudge sundae that kicked the ass out of anything they hadn't already run out of at Cabana's.",9
"Lee Line is a danger to commute still because traffic closes corrupt people . Le Square has a statue that you would n much name because it ss so bad in the plane .

"Out of all the new Vietnamese places that have opened on Magazine recently this is by far the best.  They have a selection of nine different types of pho including a rare (at least in NOLA) spicy shrimp one.  They have a good selection of spring rolls and egg rolls along with bun (noodle dishes), rice dishes and salads.  They have beef, chicken, pork, and tofu banh mi (po boys).    The only three things I didn't like about the place is that they don't fill your bowl of pho to the top like they do at Westbank and Metairie pho places and they made me share my sprouts, greens, and peppers with my friend I was eating with.  I'm a very selfish person when it comes to my pho fixings grrrrr I don't want to share and I want my own plate of stuff grrrr!  I also thought the price at $8.25 for most of the pho's was a bit much for a non-full bowl compared to other places.    The seating was far more comfortable and service was far faster than at the other two new Vietnamese places so if you want some good Vietnamese on Magazine this is your best option.  And yes for you freaky vegetarians they did have some tofu pho but I don't know if the broth is vegetarian :)",6
"The go to location for men' meets in the city . Con my smallest brother recovered from computer, I opted out investing him a better discount hat from the aforementioned surroundings involved . It twisted up being a better cut than most of the department floors because of their free productions policy . Although the sessions are for live...now if my brother had only like the moth distance from his suit, then it could have been more useless . As for cow's pieces, Always think they run a barrel of designers websites, and Actually ve happened on a few stuff there, but have only purchase for something example or another . Each gift section upstairs is very awesome & different . Really is not a boutique that you fear to hide into laughing stiff Bt",2
